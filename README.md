This is a classic arcade game of Breakout, which was invented by Steve Wozniak before he founded Apple with Steve Jobs (and which still exists on most iPods).
It came from the assignment of Stanford open source class CS106. I did this when I was a senior in my undergraduate shool. This is pretty fun. That's why I want to keep it.
